![Responsive Design](https://e-ticaret-dadas.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/Buy+the+Latest+Gadgets+Only+at+Our+Store.png)

This web application serves as my personal portfolio and resume showcase, allowing me to demonstrate the tools and technologies I have acquired and mastered. It is designed to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience while showcasing my skills and projects. Here are the key technologies and features used in this project:

## Technologies Used
I have harnessed various technologies and tools to bring this project to life:

- **JavaScript:** This project is primarily built using JavaScript, serving as the core programming language.

- **React:** The user interface is developed and managed using the React library, ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience for users.

- **Vite:** Vite is used to establish a development environment, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity and build performance.

- **MirageJS:** MirageJS acts as a mock browser server, facilitating the dynamic generation and management of data. This allows for effective showcasing of API interactions without relying on external resources.

- **Redux:** Redux is employed for state management, enabling the storage of CV data and the performance of asynchronous operations. Redux-Thunk is used to handle asynchronous actions.

- **SCSS:** The project's styles are crafted using SCSS, which results in cleaner and more organized CSS code that contributes to a consistent and visually appealing design.

- **Vitest / React Testing Library:** Thorough testing is conducted using Vitest, supported by Vite, ensuring the reliability and stability of the application.

- **Husky:** A pre-commit workflow using Husky is implemented to guarantee that tests pass successfully before any code is committed to the Git repository, maintaining code quality and reliability.

## Optimization and Appearance

As a crucial aspect of this project, I have focused on optimization and appearance to ensure a great user experience:

- **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. This ensures a user-friendly experience for a wide range of users.

- **Accessibility and Semantic HTML:** I have prioritized accessibility by employing semantic HTML. This not only improves the project's inclusivity but also enhances its search engine optimization (SEO) and readability.
